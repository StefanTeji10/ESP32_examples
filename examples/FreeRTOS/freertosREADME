FreeRtos interaction between w or more tasks

1. I want to communicate directly to another task. I care about counting or sending simple data.
1. solution --> To solve this type of communication you can use Task Notification

2. Someone needs to block or unblock a task. I don't care who.
2. solution --> In this case we can use Semaphore

3. Only the task that blocks an another task can unblock it. 
3. solution --> Mutex. This is similar to semaphore but have restriction...
Mutexes are basically there so that if something is got a precious resource 
then nobody else can interact with that resource until that Mutex is completed.

4. Task needs to pass data from one task to another. Any type of data.
4. Solution --> Queue.

5. You need multiple things to happen before I unblock a task.
Example, I need to be connected to the internet, I also need to have read the temperature. I also need to have IP address, or ... 
5. Solution --> Event group
